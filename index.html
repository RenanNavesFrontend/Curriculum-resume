            Hi! I am a front-end developer in training, passionate about creating responsive and interactive websites that truly make a difference for users. My journey in web development began in May 2024, and since then, I have been diving deep into technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Additionally, I have gained solid knowledge in Tailwind CSS, a utility-first framework that allows me to build fast and elegant interfaces, and React, a powerful library for creating dynamic and scalable user interfaces. Recently, I started working with TypeScript, which helps me write more secure and maintainable code. I also use tools like Git and GitHub to organize my projects and collaborate with other developers.

I have consistently sought ways to improve the quality and performance of the code I produce, always focusing on best practices and refactoring to make my projects more efficient and sustainable in the long run. In more recent projects, I’ve been exploring Redux and Next.js, which have allowed me to build even more robust and optimized web applications while expanding my knowledge of the React ecosystem. I am also starting to explore automated testing with Jest and React Testing Library, which has been crucial in ensuring that my projects are reliable and bug-free.

I am constantly challenging myself to improve my skills in creating responsive and accessible interfaces that work seamlessly across all devices. Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in advanced JavaScript and studying the fundamentals of UX/UI design to offer even better experiences for users. In 2025, I will begin my degree in Computer Systems Analysis, which will help me consolidate my knowledge and specialize in web development. I am very grateful to my first mentor, Professor Gabriel Salvador, who played a key role in motivating me to take the first steps in this field. With my passion for technology, games, and dogs, I continue to create dynamic and empathetic interfaces. I am excited about the future and ready to take on new challenges as I keep learning and evolving. My goal is to become a skilled front-end developer, building accessible, impactful, and useful projects. Let's build something amazing together!
